x264:
  # --demuxer: demuxer to demux the input from your script. Should always be y4m.
  - --demuxer: y4m
  - --crf: 15
  # --crf: Constant Rate Factor for the quality.
  # Ristellise (me) usually goes with 15 since it just works.
  # Though there are varying opinions on this with some going as high as 18.

  - --preset: veryslow
  # Sets a bunch of other quality settings such as rc-lookahead, ref, partitions and others.
  # There is a list of changes that x264 does for presets: http://dev.beandog.org/x264_preset_reference.html

  - --output: '{output}'
  # The output file. This is a formatted string with "output" being a pathlib.Path being provided.

  - --output-depth: "10"
  # Sets the output depth of the video.
  # If it does not watch with the input y4m, the depth will be reduced/increased to match.

  - --fps: "_auto"
  # The output fps. if the string is "_auto" or the value is empty, it will use the fps of the input clip.

  - --range: "tv"
  # Sets the color range of the video, can be either: auto, tv or pc.

  - --colormatrix: "bt709"
  # Specifies the color matrix for the output video.

  - --colorprim: "bt709"
  # Specifies the color primary for the output video.

  - --transfer: "bt709"
  # Specifies the transfer for the output video when reading from y4m to the final encode.

  - --deblock: "-2:-2"
  # Specifies the "Deblocking Strength:Deblocking threshold", also refered to as alpha and beta deblocking respectively.
  # Alpha deblocking affects over overal amount of deblocking to be applied to the picture.
  # higher=softer with less detail, lower=sharper, more details.
  # Beta Deblocking determines whether something in a block is a detail or not when deblocking is applied to it.
  # lower=apply less deblocking to more flat blocks with details
  # higher=apply more aggressive filtering to blocks that aren't very flat.

  # -2:-2 is taken from setsugen's boruto settings. Seems to work well.

  - --min-keyint: "23"
  - --keyint: "240"
  # Sets the minimum Key-Frame/Intera-frame as well as maximum interval between each I frame (--keyint)

  - --ref: "16"
  # Sets the maximum number of reference frames that can be used for B-Frames.

  - --bframes: "16"
  # Sets the number of consecutive B-frames.
  # Typically, adaptive b-frame is on. So this functions as the maximum number of B-Frames.

  - --aq-mode: "3"
  # Adaptive Quantization to better distribute bits between macroblocks:
  # 0: Don't use AQ at all.
  # 1: Redistribute bits within each frame
  # 2: Redistribute bits across the whole video
  # 3: auto-variance with dark scee bias.

  - --aq-strength: 0.95
  # Bias for low detail/flat macroblcks.

  - --qcomp: "0.72"
  # Quantizer curve compression factor. 0.0 is Constant Bitrate while 1.0 is Constant Quantizer.

  - --psy-rd: "0.90:0.0"
  # Psy-RD: Psychovisually optimized rate-distortion
  # Psy-RD measures the deviation from the source material and the bit cost for each possible decision outcome.
  # First value is Strength while the second value is for psy-trellis. For animation, disable psy-trellis.

  - --me: "tesa"
  # sets the motion estimation method. can be:
  # dia, hex, umh, esa, tesa.

  - --merange: "32"
  # Sets the max range of the motion search. Values can be between 4 to 16.

  - --direct: "spatial"
  # Set prediction mode for 'direct' motion vectors.

  - --no-dct-decimate: _
  # Disables coefficient thresholding on P frames
  - --no-fast-pskip: _
  # Disables early skip detection on P-frames.
  - --qpfile: '{vpy}'
